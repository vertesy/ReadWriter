# ReadWriter
Functions to read and write files conveniently. 
Complements the new [CodeAndRoll2](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2). Many functionalities were part of the formerly used [CodeAndRoll (v1)](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll).



<br><br>

## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

```R
# install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/Stringendo", upgrade = F)
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/ReadWriter")
```

...then simply load the package:

```R
require("ReadWriter")
```

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/ReadWriter/main/R/ReadWriter.R")
```

### Troubleshooting

*If you encounter a **bug**, something doesn't work or unclear, please let me know by raising an issue on [ReadWriter](https://github.com/vertesy/ReadWriter/issues) â€“ Please check if it has been asked.*

- #### read.simple.table

- #### read.simple.tsv 
Read in a file with excel style data: rownames in col1, headers SHIFTED. The header should start with a TAB / First column name should be empty.

- #### read.simple.csv 
Read in a file with excel style data: rownames in col1, headers SHIFTED. The header should start with a TAB / First column name should be empty.
