# ReadWriter
Functions to read and write files conveniently. 
Complements the new [CodeAndRoll2](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2). Many functionalities were part of the formerly used [CodeAndRoll (v1)](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll).

## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

```R
# install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/ReadWriter")
```

...then simply load the package:

```R
require("ReadWriter")
```

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/ReadWriter/main/R/ReadWriter.R")
```
