## Overview
ReadWriter is an R package providing convenience functions for reading from and writing to text-based data files. The package aims to streamline common I/O tasks and complements other tools in the `@vertesy` ecosystem.

## Repository structure
- `R/` – source code. All exported functions live in `ReadWriter.R`; deprecated helpers are kept in `Deprecated.Functions.R`.
- `man/` – autogenerated documentation for functions (update with `devtools::document`).
- `Development/` – scripts used to build or maintain the package; not installed with the package.
- `DESCRIPTION` – package metadata and dependency declarations.
- `README.md` – installation instructions and a high-level overview.

## Dependencies
- Requires the `@vertesy` package [`Stringendo` (>=0.5.0)](https://github.com/vertesy/Stringendo) and CRAN packages `gtools`, `openxlsx`, `qs`, and `readr`.
- Install `Stringendo` before installing ReadWriter:
  ```r
  devtools::install_github("vertesy/Stringendo", upgrade = FALSE)
  ```
- Add any new dependencies to the `Imports` field in `DESCRIPTION`.

## Development guidelines
- Place new functions in `R/ReadWriter.R` and document them with roxygen comments.
- Run `R -q -e "devtools::document()"` to regenerate Rd files before committing.
- Verify the package with `R -q -e "devtools::check(document = FALSE)"`; checks should pass with no errors.
- There is currently no automated test suite. Manual testing of new functionality is encouraged.

## Getting started
New contributors should read `README.md` for installation details and review `R/ReadWriter.R` to understand available functions. For broader context and utility helpers, explore the `Stringendo` package and other repositories in the `@vertesy` organization.
